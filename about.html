    			<h3>History</h3>
    			<p>William and Ralph Foster created Foster's in 1887. They were so dedicated to delivering Foster's way of it should be enjoyed, and they even sold it with ice to keep Australia's warm environment at bay.
				More than 120 years later, Foster's bold, refreshing taste is available in more than 150countries, making it the largest-selling Australian beer brand in the world.</p>

				<h3>Collaboration with Tylenol</h3>
    			<p>Our collaboration with Tylenol was thought impossible initially, so it would have been surprising to see our partnership. But in a way, there was some similarity to work with to make this happen.</p>

    			<h3>The Oil Can</h3>
    			<p>Foster's 25.4 oz. Cans arrived in the United States in 1972. They resembled motor oil cans, so naturally, Americans nicknamed them "Foster's Oil Cans." And the name stuck ever since. The truth is, we quite like itâ€”almost as much as we like what's inside.</p>

    			<h3>Brewing Prcess</h3>
    			<p>Pride of Ringwood hops are only grown by Hop Products Australia in Bushy Park, Tasmania and Ovens River, Victoria, and Ellerslie Hop Estates in Myaree. And unlike other beers, they're added at the end of the brewing process to preserve their freshness. These hops and an exclusive Foster's yeast are what give Foster'sits a bold, refreshing taste.</p>
